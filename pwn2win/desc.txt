ButcherCorp has developed an extremely reliable radiation-hardened IC packaging process. Its only drawback is requiring the ASIC to be fabricated using a specific 0.35Î¼m technology, considered outdated by today's standards. The intel we gathered suggests that their standard cell library is based on osu035.One of our operatives managed to exfiltrate a GDSII file ButcherCorp has sent to a silicon fab. Apparently, it is the IC responsible for validating the launching code in their latest rocket engine.The IC samples the in pin at the clock's positive edge. If the correct sequence of bits is presented to the IC, it drives the unlocked pin to a high logical level. Find this sequence. It forms an ASCII string which you should submit as a flag.
